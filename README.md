<u>Answer 3:</u> Event bubbling is where an event starts at the specific element (target) and then "bubbles up" through its ancestors in the DOM tree until it reaches the window.<br>
<u>Answer 4:</u> Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of attaching multiple listeners to every individual child element. Eventually the event bubbles up.<br>
<u>Answer 5:</u> preventDefault() stops the browser's default behavior and stopPropagation() stops the event from traveling up the DOM tree.
